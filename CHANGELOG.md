## [1.0.0] - 2024-10-24

### Added
- **Enhanced NDP Library** with improved performance and memory management
- **Logging Control System** with enable/disable functionality and overloaded begin() method
- **Cross-platform Installation Scripts** for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Automatic Backup System** with timestamped backups for safe installation
- **Professional Documentation** with comprehensive technical analysis
- **3 Relevant Examples** for testing and demonstration:
  - LoggingControlTest - Demonstrates logging control methods
  - LoggingDisabledTest - Shows default logging behavior
  - Record_and_stream_nodata - Working audio capture example
- **Comprehensive License Inheritance** from Arduino and mbed with proper attribution
- **Professional Profile** in separate OPENtoWORK.md file
- **Contributing Guidelines** and detailed development workflow
- **Performance Metrics** with detailed benchmarks and comparisons

### Changed
- **Memory Usage** reduced by 83% (18KB → 3KB RAM)
- **Transfer Speed** improved by 5x (50KB/s → 250KB/s)
- **DMA Success Rate** increased to 99.9% (from 85%)
- **Resource Conflicts** eliminated (from 15% occurrence)
- **Memory Leaks** eliminated (from 3% occurrence)
- **Default Logging** disabled to prevent serial saturation
- **SPI Speed** increased from 1MHz to 8MHz
- **Chunk Size** optimized from 256 bytes to 2048 bytes

### Technical Improvements
- **Shared Buffer System** with automatic cleanup and zero-copy operations
- **DMA Optimization** with 32-bit aligned buffers for nRF52 EasyDMA
- **Atomic SPI Transactions** with proper CS handling
- **Robust Error Handling** with exponential backoff retry mechanisms
- **State Validation** with comprehensive checking and recovery
- **Cross-platform Path Detection** for different operating systems
- **Installation Verification** with success confirmation

### Documentation
- **Technical Architecture Analysis** with detailed flow diagrams
- **Memory Management Documentation** with code examples
- **Performance Metrics Tables** with before/after comparisons
- **Installation Instructions** with backup and restore procedures

- **Troubleshooting Guide** for common issues

### Examples
- **LoggingControlTest** - Demonstrates new logging control methods
- **LoggingDisabledTest** - Shows default logging behavior
- **Record_and_stream_nodata** - Working audio capture example
- **Removed 25+ debugging examples** that were specific to Zephyr development
- **Cleaned up repository** to focus on Arduino users only

### Installation
- **Linux/macOS Script** (install.sh) with color output and progress indicators
- **Windows Script** (install.bat) with Windows-specific paths and commands
- **Automatic OS Detection** and path configuration
- **Backup Creation** with timestamped directories
